title: Server and Client Components
description: What Server and Client Components are, and how to use them in your React applications.
---

React is a JavaScript library that lets you build user interfaces using individual components. Traditionally, these components were only rendered on the client, but in version 18, React introduced components that could be rendered on the server - changing the way we think about building frontend applications.

To differentiate between these two types of components, a new naming convention was introduced: **Server Components** and **Client Components**. On this page, we'll cover what Server and Client Components are, and how to use them in your React applications.
