Data fetching is a core part of any application. This page goes through how you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data with React and Next.js. It also covers recommended patterns for fetching data with React.

## Fetching Data in Server Components

Next.js extends the native [`fetch` Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to allow you to:

- Configure the [caching](#caching-data) and [revalidating](#revalidating-data) behavior for each fetch request **on the server**.
- Automatically [memoize](#fetching-data-where-its-needed-memoization) fetch requests in a React Component tree.

### Using the `fetch` API

You can use `fetch` with [`async`/`await` in Server Components](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises) to fetch data on the server:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.

  // Recommendation: handle errors
  if (!res.ok) {
    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
  }

  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()

  return <main></main>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.

  // Recommendation: handle errors
  if (!res.ok) {
    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
  }

  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()

  return <main></main>
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> To use `async`/`await` in a Server Component with TypeScript, you'll need to use TypeScript `5.1.3` or higher and `@types/react` `18.2.8` or higher.
> Next.js provides helpful server functions you may need when fetching data in Server Components such as [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers). These will cause the route to be dynamically rendered as they rely on runtime information.

### Caching Data

Caching is the process of storing data on the server (e.g. an [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview)) so it doesn't need to be re-fetched from your data source on each request.

By default, Next.js automatically caches the returned values of `fetch` in the [Data Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching#data-cache) on the server. This means that the data will be fetched at build time, cached, and reused on each request.

```js
fetch('https://...') // cache: 'force-cache' is the default, and can be omitted
```

> **How does the Data Cache work?**
>
> The Data Cache is a persistent [HTTP cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching). Depending on your platform, the cache can scale automatically and be shared across multiple regions.
>
> Next.js extends the [options object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#:~:text=preflight%20requests.-,cache,-A%20string%20indicating) of the `fetch` function to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching behavior.
> During server rendering, when Next.js comes across a fetch, it will check the cache to see if the data is already available. If it is, it will return the cached data. If not, it will fetch and store data for future requests.
>
> Learn more about the [Data Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching#data-cache).

### Revalidating Data

Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.

Cached data can be revalidated in two ways:

- **Time-based revalidation**: Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical. Time-based revalidation can be configured with the [Route Segment Config options](#segment-config-options) or per individual [`fetch` request](#fetchoptionsnextrevalidate).
- **On-demand revalidation**: Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful for when you want to ensure the latest data is always shown. On-demand revalidation can be configured with the [`revalidateTag`](#fetchoptionsnexttag-and-revalidatetag) and [`revalidatePath`](#revalidatepath) APIs.

### Revalidating Data

To revalidate [cached data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching) at a timed interval, you can use the `next.revalidate` option in `fetch()` to set the `cache` lifetime of a resource (in seconds).

```ts
fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 10 } })
```

See [Revalidating Data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating) for more information.

> **Good to know**:
>
> Caching at the fetch level with `revalidate` or `cache: 'force-cache'` stores the data across requests in a shared cache. You should avoid using it for user-specific data (i.e. requests that derive data from `cookies()` or `headers()`)

## Dynamic Data Fetching

To fetch fresh data on every `fetch` request, use the `cache: 'no-store'` option.

```ts
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' })
```

## Data Fetching Patterns

### Parallel Data Fetching

To minimize client-server waterfalls, we recommend this pattern to fetch data in parallel:

```tsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.tsx" switcher
import Albums from './albums'

async function getArtist(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)
  return res.json()
}

async function getArtistAlbums(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({
  params: { username },
}: {
  params: { username: string }
}) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumsData = getArtistAlbums(username)

  // Wait for the promises to resolve
  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Albums list={albums}></Albums>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.js" switcher
import Albums from './albums'

async function getArtist(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)
  return res.json()
}

async function getArtistAlbums(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumsData = getArtistAlbums(username)

  // Wait for the promises to resolve
  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Albums list={albums}></Albums>
    </>
  )
}
```

By starting the fetch prior to calling `await` in the Server Component, each request can eagerly start to fetch requests at the same time. This sets the components up so you can avoid waterfalls.

We can save time by initiating both requests in parallel, however, the user won't see the rendered result until both promises are resolved.

To improve the user experience, you can add a [suspense boundary](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to break up the rendering work and show part of the result as soon as possible:

```tsx filename="artist/[username]/page.tsx" switcher
import { getArtist, getArtistAlbums, type Album } from './api'

export default async function Page({
  params: { username },
}: {
  params: { username: string }
}) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumData = getArtistAlbums(username)

  // Wait for the artist's promise to resolve first
  const artist = await artistData

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Send the artist information first,
          and wrap albums in a suspense boundary */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Albums promise={albumData} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

// Albums Component
async function Albums({ promise }: { promise: Promise<Album[]> }) {
  // Wait for the albums promise to resolve
  const albums = await promise

  return (
    <ul>
      {albums.map((album) => (
        <li key={album.id}>{album.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="artist/[username]/page.js" switcher
import { getArtist, getArtistAlbums } from './api'

export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumData = getArtistAlbums(username)

  // Wait for the artist's promise to resolve first
  const artist = await artistData

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Send the artist information first,
      and wrap albums in a suspense boundary */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Albums promise={albumData} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

// Albums Component
async function Albums({ promise }) {
  // Wait for the albums promise to resolve
  const albums = await promise

  return (
    <ul>
      {albums.map((album) => (
        <li key={album.id}>{album.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Take a look at the [preloading pattern](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching#preload-pattern-with-cache) for more information on improving components structure.

### Sequential Data Fetching

To fetch data sequentially, you can `fetch` directly inside the component that needs it, or you can `await` the result of `fetch` inside the component that needs it:

```tsx filename="app/artist/page.tsx" switcher
// ...

async function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {
  // Wait for the playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)

  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default async function Page({
  params: { username },
}: {
  params: { username: string }
}) {
  // Wait for the artist
  const artist = await getArtist(username)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/artist/page.js" switcher
// ...

async function Playlists({ artistID }) {
  // Wait for the playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)

  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Wait for the artist
  const artist = await getArtist(username)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

By fetching data inside the component, each fetch request and nested segment in the route cannot start fetching data and rendering until the previous request or segment has completed.

### Blocking Rendering in a Route

By fetching data in a [layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), rendering for all route segments beneath it can only start once the data has finished loading.

In the `pages` directory, pages using server-rendering would show the browser loading spinner until `getServerSideProps` had finished, then render the React component for that page. This can be described as "all or nothing" data fetching. Either you had the entire data for your page, or none.

In the `app` directory, you have additional options to explore:

1. First, you can use `loading.js` to show an instant loading state from the server while streaming in the result from your data fetching function.
2. Second, you can move data fetching _lower_ in the component tree to only block rendering for the parts of the page that need it. For example, moving data fetching to a specific component rather than fetching it at the root layout.

Whenever possible, it's best to fetch data in the segment that uses it. This also allows you to show a loading state for only the part of the page that is loading, and not the entire page.

## Data Fetching without `fetch()`

You might not always have the ability to use and configure `fetch` requests directly if you're using a third-party library such as an ORM or database client.

In cases where you cannot use `fetch` but still want to control the caching or revalidating behavior of a layout or page, you can rely on the [default caching behavior](#default-caching-behavior) of the segment or use the [segment cache configuration](#segment-cache-configuration).

### Default Caching Behavior

Any data fetching libraries that do not use `fetch` directly **will not** affect caching of a route, and will be static or dynamic depending on the route segment.

If the segment is static (default), the output of the request will be cached and revalidated (if configured) alongside the rest of the segment. If the segment is dynamic, the output of the request will _not_ be cached and will be re-fetched on every request when the segment is rendered.

> **Good to know**: Dynamic functions like [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) will make the route segment dynamic.

### Segment Cache Configuration

As a temporary solution, until the caching behavior of third-party queries can be configured, you can use [segment configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#revalidate) to customize the cache behavior of the entire segment.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import prisma from './lib/prisma'

export const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate every hour

async function getPosts() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()
  return posts
}

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import prisma from './lib/prisma'

export const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate every hour

async function getPosts() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()
  return posts
}

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  // ...
}
```
