description: An overview of caching mechanisms in Next.js.

Next.js has a few caching mechanisms to improve your application's performance. This page provides an overview of the different mechanisms, how they affect each other, and how you can use them.

Please note that some are handled automatically, while others can be manually configured. Caching is also split between rendering output and fetched data, client and server environments.

| Mechanism                | Purpose                                                                                                                                    | What is cached?                                                        | Where is it cached?               | Duration                                                                                                           | APIs                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static Rendering         | Reduce the rendering cost of content that doesn’t change. All routes are statically rendered by default unless they use dynamic functions. | Pre-rendered Client Components, and Rendered Server Components Payload | Server (CDN)                      | Persistent or revalidate lifetime                                                                                  | Route Segment Config, and Dynamic Functions                                            |
| Client-side Router Cache | Improve navigation performance. Stores RSC payloads, previously fetched and soon to be fetched (prefetch)                                  | Rendered Server Component Payload                                      | Client (in-memory)                | Single Session (cleared by hard navigation or refresh), or 30s for dynamic routes, and 5 minutes for static routes | `<Link>`, `router.prefetch`, `router.refresh`, `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag`       |
| Next.js Data Cache       | Store data across deployments, reduce data store calls                                                                                     | Data                                                                   | Server (CDN)                      | Persistent or revalidate lifetime                                                                                  | `fetch.cache`, `fetch.revalidate`, `unstable_cache`, `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag` |
| Extended fetch API       | Deduplicate requests for the same data across a route render pass. Internally uses React.cache                                             | Data                                                                   | Server (in-memory)                | Per request / render pass                                                                                          | `fetch`                                                                                |
| React cache              | Memoize function calls across a render pass. For cases where fetch cannot be used.                                                         | The returned result of a function, can be data                         | Server (in-memory)                | Per request / render pass                                                                                          | `React.cache`                                                                          |
| Next.js unstable_cache   | Allows use cases that can’t use fetch to store data in Next.js Data Cache                                                                  | Data                                                                   | Server (CDN) - Next.js Data Cache | Persistent or revalidate lifetime                                                                                  | `unstable_cache`                                                                       |
