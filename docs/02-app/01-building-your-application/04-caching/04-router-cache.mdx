title: Router Cache
description: Learn how Next.js optimizes the navigation experience by caching route segments on the client.
---

The Next.js App Router uses an in-memory client-side cache that stores the rendered result of Server Components, split by invidiual route segments. This **Router Cache** is used to improve navigation performance by only [partially rendering]() the content that changes (instead of the whole route) and prefetching content that the user is likely going to navigate to. It stores both visited segments and prefetched segments.

For the user, this results in [soft navigation]() (no page reloads) and faster page transitions; it also reduces unnecessary requests to the server.

> **Client-side Cache and Prefetch Cache**
>
> You may see this cache being referred to as **Client-side Cache** or **Prefetch Cache**. While **Prefetch Cache** refers to the prefetched segments, **Client-side Cache** refers to the whole Router cache, which includes both visited and prefetched segments.
> This cache specifically applies to Next.js and Server Components, and is different to the browser's [bfcache](https://web.dev/bfcache/).

## How it works

When the user first visits a route, Next.js will cache the rendered result of the route segments (layouts and page). If the route contains `<Link>` components (or uses `router.prefetch`), Next.js will automatically start prefetching and caching the content of those linked routes.

As users navigate between routes, Next.js will check if the route segments are already cached. If so, it will skip sending a new request to the server for rendering, and use the payload of cached segments instead. This works when navigating to new routes, as well as backwards and forwards browser navigation.

> **What is the rendered result?**
>
> You may see the terms like **RSC Payload**, **Rendered Result**, and **Flight Data** used interchangeably. They all refer to the same thing: the rendered result of Server Components, which is sent to the client. To learn more, see the [Server Components]() documentation.

## Duration and Invalidation

The cache is stored in the browser's temporary memory. There are two factors that determine how long the router cache lasts:

- **Session**: The cache persists across soft navigation. However, it's cleared on page refresh or [hard navigation]().
- **Automatic invalidation period**: The cache of an individual segment is automatically invalidated after a time period. The duration depends on whether the route is [static]() or [dynamic]():
  - **Dynamic routes**: 30 seconds
  - **Static routes**: 5 minutes

While a page refresh or hard navigation will clear **all** cached segments, the automatic invalidation period only affects the individual segment from the time it was last accessed or created.

## APIs

The following APIs affect the Router Cache:

### `<Link>`

By default, the `<Link>` component automatically prefetches linked routes. This adds the rendered result to the cache.

To disable prefetching, you can set the `prefetch` prop to `false`.

Learn more about the [`<Link>` component]().

### `router.prefetch`

The `prefetch` option of the `useRouter` hook can be used to manually prefetch a route. This adds the rendered result to the cache.

See the [`useRouter` hook]() API reference.

### `router.refresh`

The `refresh` method of the `useRouter` hook can be used to manually refresh a route. This completely clears the router cache, makes a new request to the server, refetches data (which may be cached - see [Interactions]()), and re-renders Server Components from the root layout down to the page.

The rendered result will be merged with client components without losing the client-side React state or browser state (e.g. scroll position).

See the [`useRouter` hook]() API reference.

### `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag`

The `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` methods invalidates the [data cache]() below the path provided, which in turn invalidates the Router Cache.

> **Difference between `router.refresh` and `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag`:**
>
> Similarly to `router.refresh`, using these methods clears the router cache, makes a new request to the server, fetches data, and re-renders Server Components from the root layout down to page.
>
> The difference is that `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` **revalidates** cached data, whereas `router.refresh` **reuses** cached data.

For more, see the [`revalidatePath`]() and [`revalidateTag`]() API references.

### `cookies`

Using `cookies.set` or `cookies.delete` in Server Action invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale (e.g. authentication).

See the [`cookies`]() API reference.
