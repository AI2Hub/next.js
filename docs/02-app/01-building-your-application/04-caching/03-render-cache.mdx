Next.js automatically caches the rendered result of React Components on the server at build time. This is an optimization that allows you to skip rendering components on the server on every request, and instead directly send the cached result to the client, resulting in faster page loads.

## How it works

To understand how Render Cache works, it's helpful to look at how React handles rendering, and how Next.js caches the output of React rendering. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. First, React renders Server Components on the server, and serializes Client Component props.
2. Next.js then caches the result of the rendering work on the server (this is the Render Cache).
3. When a user makes a request, Next.js caches the rendering work on the client, separated by route segments (this is the [Router Cache]()).
4. On the client, React [hydrates]() the components, and reconciles the Server and Client Component trees.

## 1. React Rendering on the Server

On the server, React Rendering is split into three stages:

1. React renders Server Components into a special format, called the [**React Payload**]() or **RSC Payload**. Client Component props are also serialized and embedded into this payload.
2. React then uses the payload to render HTML.
3. The Payload is embedded into the HTML, ready to be sent to the client.

### 2. Next.js Caching on the Server (Render Cache)

React Rendering can happen at build time (when deploying your application) or request time (when a user visits your application).

In Next.js, React rendering and the resulting HTML and Payload are cached at build time. It's important to note that the rendered output isn't a single, large output, but instead is split into individual chunks, one for each route segment.

### 3. React Hydration on the Client

Then, on the client, the HTML is used to show an initial preview, while the payload is used to [hydrate]() the HTML.

Note: Although a real RSC implementation does encode the JSX in the HTML payload, there are a few important differences. A production-ready RSC setup sends JSX chunks as they're being produced instead of a single large blob at the end. When React loads, hydration can start immediately—React starts traversing the tree using the JSX chunks that are already available instead of waiting for all of them to arrive. RSC also lets you mark some components as Client components, which means they still get SSR'd into HTML, but their code is included in the bundle. For Client components, only JSON of their props gets serialized. In the future, React may add extra mechanisms to deduplicate content between HTML and the embedded payload.

## Subsequent Navigation

you may remember gssp / gsp sent a JSON payload of the initial props of a page. in app router, props passed from server components to client components are serialized and embedded into the rsc payload.

At build time:

- Server Components are rendered into their payload.
- Client Component props are serialized and embedded into the payload.
- The payload is used to generate HTML.

> **What is the Payload?**

The **HTML**, and the **Payload**, are then cached (where?) before being sent to the client. Once on the client:

- The HTML is used to show an initial preview.
- React uses the HTML and JavaScript instructions to **hydrate** Client Components and make them interactive.
- React uses the Payload to reconcile the rendered Server and Client Component trees.

> **What is hydration?**

> Hydration is the process in which React parses the HTML, and uses the JavaScript instructions to attach event handlers to the DOM. This turns makes the HTML markup interactive.

## Duration and Invalidation

## APIs

The following APIs affect the Render Cache:

### `fetch.cache` and `cache: no-store`

When fetching data, setting the `cache` option to `no-store` will re-render the components on every request, and the result will not be cached.

### `cookies`

### `headers`

### `useSearchParams`

### `searchParams`
