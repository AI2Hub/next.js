description: Learn how Next.js optimizes performance by caching rendered React Components on the server (static rendering), and how to opt into dynamic rendering.
---

Next.js automatically caches the rendered result of React Components on the server at build time. This is an optimization that allows you to skip rendering components on the server on every request, and instead directly send the cached result to the client, resulting in faster page loads.

## How it works

To understand how Render Cache works, it's helpful to look at how React handles rendering, and how Next.js caches the output of React rendering. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

## 1. React Rendering on the Server

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate React rendering. This process is split into three stages:

1. React renders Server Components into a special format, designed for streaming, called the [**React Server Payload**](). This Payload contains:

- The rendered result of Server Components
- References to the locations where Client Components should be rendered
  - Any serialized props passed to these Client Components
  - References to the JavaScript instructions needed to render the Client Components
- References to stylesheets
- Metadata tags

2. Next.js compiles, bundles and code-splits the JavaScript instructions for rendering Client Components (on the client).
3. The React Payload and Client Component instructions are used to pre-render HTML.

### 2. Next.js Caching on the Server (Render Cache)

For [static routes](), Next.js caches the React Server Payload, pre-rendered HTML, and Client Component bundles on the server, at build time. This render output is split into individual chunks, to enable [streaming]().

### 3. Next.js Caching on the Client (Router Cache)

At request time, the React Server Payload, pre-rendered HTML, and Client Component bundles are sent to the client and populate the [Router Cache](). This is a separate in-memory client cache that stores the render output in the browser, split by in individual route segments.

The [Router cache]() is used to improve the navigation experience by prefetching route segments, and reducing server requests for route segments that do not change between navigations. Learn more about the [Router Cache]().

### 4. React Hydration and Consolidation on the Client

Then, on the client:

1. The HTML is used to show an initial preview.
2. The React payload is used to consolidate the Client and Server Component trees.
3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate]() Client Components.

### 5. Subsequent Navigations

On subsequent navigations or during prefetching, Next.js will check if the route segments are already in the Router Cache. If so, it will not hit the Render Cache.

If the route segments are not cached, Next.js will fetch the render output from the Render Cache on the server, and populate the Router Cache on the client.

## Duration and Invalidation

By default, the Render Cache is persistent. This means that the render output is cached across user requests and deployments, unless you revalidate or opt out of caching.

## APIs

The following APIs affect the Render Cache:

### `fetch.cache` and `cache: no-store`

When fetching data, setting the `cache` option to `no-store` will re-render the components on every request, and the result will not be cached.

### `cookies`

### `headers`

### `useSearchParams`

### `searchParams`
