Next.js has a few caching mechanisms to improve your application's performance. This page provides an in-depth look at caching, the APIs you can use to configure them, and how they interact with each other.

## Overview

{/* TO DO: Diagram showing how caching mechanisms come into play in the request lifecycle, going from  initial request, to server, to response, to router cache, to subsequent navigation with new request. */}

Here's a high-level overview of the different caching mechanisms in Next.js and their purpose:

| Mechanism                     | What is cached?                | Where is it cached? | Why is it cached?                                             | Duration                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [React Cache](#react-cache)   | Return values of functions     | Server              | Reduce data store calls and share data between route segments | Per-request lifecycle           |
| [Data Cache](#data-cache)     | Return values of data requests | Server              | Store data across user requests and deployments               | Persistent (can be revalidated) |
| [Render Cache](#render-cache) | Rendered React Components      | Server              | Reduce rendering cost and improve performance                 | Persistent (can be revalidated) |
| [Router Cache](#router-cache) | Route Segments (RSC Payload)   | Client              | Reduce server requests and improve navigation experience      | User session or time-based.     |

## How caching works

### React Cache

React's `cache` function allows you to **memoize** the return value of a function, saving the result to memory. This means you can call the same function multiple times while only executing it once during a render pass.

In Next.js, the `fetch` API uses `cache` to **deduplicate** requests for the same data. Similar to memoization, request deduplication is an optimization that takes **multiple** requests for the same data and only makes a **single** request to the data source. This is done by storing the result of the first request in a temporary server-side cache, and returning the cached result for subsequent requests.

{/* Diagram */}

Since `fetch` requests are automatically deduplicated, you can fetch data in the components that need it without props drilling and worrying about the performance impact of making multiple requests for the same data. Deduplication applies to `fetch` requests in `generateMetadata`, `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, Pages, and other Server Components.

For cases where `fetch` is not suitable (e.g. database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL), you can use React's `cache` function to manually deduplicate requests. Although Next.js uses `cache` to memoize data requests on the server, the `cache` function can also be used to memoize any function on the server or the client.

> **Memoization vs. Deduplication**:
>
> You may see the terms **memoization** and **deduplication** being used interchangeably. Memoization is a general term that applies storing the return values of **any function** in-memory, whereas request deduplication applies specifically to **data requests**.

#### Duration

The cache lasts the lifetime of a server request until the rendering pass completes.

#### Revalidating

Since the cache is cleared after each request, there is no need to revalidate the cache.

#### Opting out

There's no way to opt out of request deduplication for `fetch` requests.

### Data Cache

Next.js has a built-in Data Cache that stores the result of data requests across user requests and deployments.

By default, data requests that use `fetch` are automatically cached at build time. This is possible because Next.js extends the native `fetch` API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.

You can use the [`cache`]() and [`next.revalidate`]() options of `fetch` to configure the caching behavior. In the browser, `cache` indicates how a fetch request will interact with the browser's HTTP cache, and with Next.js, the `cache` option also indicates how a server-side fetch request will interact with the framework's persistent HTTP cache.

When fetching data on the server, a `fetch` request first checks the persistent HTTP cache for a cached response. If a cached response is found, it is returned immediately. If not, the request is made to the data source, and the response is cached.

> **Static vs. Dynamic Data Fetching**:
>
> You may see the terms **Static Data Fetching** and **Dynamic Data Fetching** being used. Static Data Fetching refers to cached data requests (default), whereas Dynamic Data Fetching refers to data that is fetched on every request, at runtime.

#### Duration

The Data Cache is persistent across user requests and deployments unless you revalidate or opt-out.

#### Revalidating

Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.

Cached data can be revalidated in two ways:

- **Time-based revalidation**: Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical. Time-based revalidation can be configured with the [Route Segment Config options]() or per individual [`fetch` request]().
- **On-demand revalidation**: Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful for when you want to ensure the latest data is always shown. On-demand revalidation can be configured with the [`revalidateTag`]() and [`revalidatePath`]() APIs.

> **Vercel Data Cache**
>
> If your Next.js application is deployed to Vercel, we recommend reading the [Vercel Data Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/data-cache) documentation for a better understanding of Vercel specific features.

#### Opting out

For individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the `cache` option to `no-store`. This means data will be fetched dynamically, on each request.

```jsx
// Opt out of caching
fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })
```

Alternatively, you can also use the [Route Segment Config options]() to opt out of caching for **all** data requests in a route segment.
