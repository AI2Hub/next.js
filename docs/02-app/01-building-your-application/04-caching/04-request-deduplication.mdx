## Request Deduplication

<!-- - Change in React's API design
- Allows us to think about components in isolation
- Fetch liberally without worrying about performance
- Rely on the system to handle optimization
- Replacement for passing data as from layout to page -->

Request deduplication is an optimization that takes **multiple** requests for the same data and only makes a **single** request to the data source. This is done by storing the result of the first request in a temporary cache, and returning the cached result for subsequent requests.

For example, if you need to fetch the same data (e.g. current user) in multiple components in a tree, Next.js will temporarily cache `fetch` requests that have the same input, and only make one request to the data source.

> **Good to know:**

> You may also hear this concept referred to as **memoization**. This is a similar term that applies to the return value of a function call, whereas **request deduplication** applies specifically to the result of a data request.

### Duration

The cache lasts the lifetime of a server request until the rendering process completes.

### APIs

#### Extended `fetch` API

Request deduplication is automatically applied to `fetch` requests used in Layouts, Pages, Server Components, `generateMetadata`, and `generateStaticParams` across the same render pass.

Internally, `fetch` uses React's `cache` function.

#### React `cache`

React's `cache` function allows you to memoize the return value of a function, allowing you to call the same function multiple times while only executing it once.

You can use it to manually deduplicate data requests for use cases when the `fetch` API is not suitable. For example, database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL.

```tsx filename="utils/get-user.ts" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async (id: string) => {
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ id })
  return user
})
```

```jsx filename="utils/get-user.js" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async (id) => {
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ id })
  return user
})
```

> **Good to know:**

> - You can use `cache` to memoize any function, not just data requests.
> - Next.js uses `cache` to memoize data requests on the server, however, `cache` can also be used on the client.
